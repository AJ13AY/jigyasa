                <p>Recognizing employees, volunteers, students, and even (sometimes) bosses for their
                 hard work is a fundamental building block to creating healthy working relationships. 
                 Whether the words of appreciation come with a bonus, are given at a ceremony, 
                 or are simply said at a daily meeting, including a certificate of appreciation
                  will give the recipient a lasting memento to remind them of the work they’ve done, 
                  the thanks they’ve received, and the positive effects they’ve had on the people around them.</p>
